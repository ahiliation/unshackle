unshackle is a set of programs to:

  * control an amateur radio rig from anywhere using rigserve
  * listen to audio using libjingle.
  * transmit audio with a low latency.
  * (later) broadcast streaming audio over the internet from one's rig.

A note on the license. unshackle was initially under New BSD, but Google changed the libjingle license to gplv2, so I change unshackle code to gplv2. I do not see any changes in the libjingle source code SVN changes though.. Let me make it clear that ilbc code also in unshackle svn is not under gplv2. It has its own license as detailed under its source code root.
